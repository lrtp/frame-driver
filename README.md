# frame-driver
#frame used as driver

WHAT IS IT?

When you write #frame in a value, it creates a driver that will use the variable frame as scripted expression.
Once that driver is created, you should write frame without #, as this is the actual variable name.
Think of #frame as meaning "make a driver with frame in it".
